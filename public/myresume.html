    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹<br />
        I recently became a UX/UI designer after 10 years working in graphic design.<br/>
        How? I've decided to take a risk and played all my cards: I quit my job and signed up<br/>
        for the UX/UI design course at EDIT. Iâ€™m happy to shift my career, by transitioning<br/>
        into a new field where I can use my skills in a more meaningful way and I'm more<br/>
        than excited to start creating solutions that really add value to people's lives.
    </p>
